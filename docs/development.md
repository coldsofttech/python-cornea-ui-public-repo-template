# Development

## Layout

```text
src/example_package/   library: all the logic, never prints or exits (typed)
src/example_cli/       Typer + Rich command line: parses input, calls the library, shows output
src/example_api/       FastAPI app: routers, schemas, errors, settings (see api.md)
src/example_ui/        Cornea Shell wiring and the `example-ui` command (see ui.md)
src/example_ui/ui/     React + Vite frontend (JavaScript)
tests/                 pytest tests, one folder per component: core/, cli/, api/, ui/ (each with integration/)
installer/             PyInstaller specs, NSIS scripts, nfpm config, pinned tool versions (see packaging.md)
scripts/               repository settings, OpenAPI export, installer build, release manifests
docs/                  documentation, including the generated openapi.json and cli-reference.md
pyproject.toml         metadata, dependencies and tool configuration
uv.lock                locked dependencies (commit this file)
```

The example names are `example_package` (library), `example_cli` (command line package), `example_api`, `example_ui`, and the commands `example-cli` and `example-ui`. After creating a repo from this template, run the **Init** workflow with a short lowercase `name` (for example `acme`) and a display `title` (for example "Acme Studio"). It opens a pull request that:

- replaces the owner and repository name;
- renames the packages (`acme_package`, `acme_cli`, `acme_api`, `acme_ui`), the commands (`acme-cli`, `acme-ui`), the settings prefix (`ACME_API_`) and the app id, and replaces "Example App" with your title;
- generates new product GUIDs for the Windows installers, then regenerates `uv.lock`, `docs/cli-reference.md` and `docs/openapi.json`.

The rename is `scripts/init_template.py` (it replaces only those exact patterns, so prose such as "for example" is left alone, and it deletes itself afterwards). The workflows and the installer scripts read names from `pyproject.toml` (`[project.scripts]` and `[tool.installer]`, through `installer/projectinfo.py`), so they need no renaming. If you add a new place that uses an example name, keep it in one of the patterns the script knows.

What is left for you:

1. Replace the window icon (`src/<ui package>/ui/public/icon.png`).
2. Set the description and URLs, and add an email to the author, in `pyproject.toml`.
3. Review the pull request for lines that still say "example" (the script lists them).
4. Replace the example React app, API routes and window action.

See [packaging](packaging.md) and [releasing](releasing.md) for the installers and the first-release checklist.

Commands, options and exit codes are documented in [CLI reference](cli.md).

## Tooling

| Purpose | Tool |
| --- | --- |
| Environment, dependencies, build | [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) with Hatchling |
| Lint and format | Ruff |
| Type checking | mypy (strict) |
| Tests and coverage | pytest with pytest-cov (80% minimum) |
| API | FastAPI, uvicorn, pydantic-settings; Schemathesis for contract tests |
| Window | `cornea-shell` (Windows only) |
| Frontend | Node 22 or newer, Vite, React, Vitest, ESLint, Prettier |

```bash
uv sync                    # create .venv and install dev dependencies
uv run pytest              # unit tests with coverage (skips integration tests)
uv run pytest -m integration --no-cov   # integration tests only
uv run ruff check .        # lint
uv run ruff format .       # format
uv run mypy                # type check
uv build                   # build the sdist and wheel (core library and command line only)
```

Frontend, from `src/example_ui/ui` (or with `--prefix`):

```bash
npm ci                     # install exactly what package-lock.json says
npm run dev                # Vite dev server; `uv run python -m example_ui --dev` wraps it in the window
npm run build              # writes dist/, which the window serves and the Windows installer freezes in
npm run lint && npm test   # ESLint, Vitest
npm run format             # Prettier
```

Other useful commands:

```bash
uv run python -m example_api              # run the API on its own (see api.md)
uv run python scripts/export_openapi.py   # regenerate docs/openapi.json
uv run python -m example_ui --no-window   # serve the UI for a browser
```

## Integration tests

Tests are grouped by component: `tests/core/`, `tests/cli/`, `tests/api/` and `tests/ui/`. Each has an `integration/` folder, and tests in any `integration/` folder are marked `integration` automatically by `tests/conftest.py`. Run one component with, for example, `uv run pytest tests/api --no-cov`. They are excluded from the default `pytest` run, and therefore from the pre-commit hook, and run as their own job in CI. Put slower or end-to-end tests there. They include a real API server, a Schemathesis contract test and, on Windows with a built frontend, a real Cornea server without a window.

## Continuous integration

The `ci` workflow runs six jobs: `lint` (pre-commit including Ruff, mypy, ESLint and Prettier, plus the generated-file checks), `ui` (frontend lint, tests and build), `test` (unit tests), `integration` (tests marked `integration`), `ui-windows` (the real Cornea test against the built frontend), and `build` (the wheel, `twine check`). The `test` and `integration` jobs run on Python 3.11 to 3.15 on Ubuntu, and on 3.11 on Windows and macOS. A final `ci` job gates on all of them and is the single required check in the branch ruleset.

## Releasing to PyPI

This section covers the PyPI side. Installers, signing and the package managers are in [releasing](releasing.md) and [packaging](packaging.md).

Publishing uses [trusted publishing](https://docs.pypi.org/trusted-publishers/), so no API token is stored.

1. On PyPI, add a trusted publisher for this repository: workflow `release.yml`, environment `pypi`.
2. Create an environment named `pypi`. The settings script does this and restricts it to `v*` tags.
3. Bump `__version__` in `src/<package>/__init__.py` and update `CHANGELOG.md`.
4. Publish a GitHub release tagged `v<version>`. The workflow fails if the tag and version differ.
